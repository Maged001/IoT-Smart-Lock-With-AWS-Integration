# IoT Smart Lock with AWS Integration

## Overview
Developed as a senior project for a Computer Engineering program, this project delivers an advanced IoT smart lock system, utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) for secure and scalable cloud-based management. The system's main access mechanism is a token-based authentication, issued by the admin, which specifies the date and time a user is granted access.

## Features
- **Token-Based Access**: Admin-controlled tokens grant time-specific access to users.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes ESP32 for lock operations with multiple unlocking mechanisms including fingerprint sensor, keypad, and RFID.
- **Cloud Management**: Employs AWS services for reliable and centralized control.
- **Admin Interface**: A dedicated webpage for remote user management and permissions.
